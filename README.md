# The Moving Furniture Problem.

This is a classic CS problem! 

Given a room is arranged in a certain way, and we would like to move the furniture to a new configuration (without taking any furniture out of the room), how do we do this most efficiently? Is it even possible?

Some classic attempts at solving this problem:

A faculty member mentioned to me that he wanted to implement this for-real in a room by attaching wheels and motors to all of the furniture. But first, we had to solve the problem!

Thus began my independent study - it was my job to simulate algorithms from papers in this field.

In Java using Swing, I built a MVC architecture to simulate furniture movement and recreated the professor's office & conference room (as well as a few other test rooms, including a randomized test room) virtually. This way, we could implement the algorithms and test their efficiency virtually before deciding which one to implement in the real world.

Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic prevented us from working on the physical part of the project together, but I hope to revisit this in the future!

This repo consists of the virtual portion of our efforts.
